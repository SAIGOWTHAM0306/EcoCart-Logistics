Streamlining E-commerce Deliveries with Salesforce.
In the fast-growing e-commerce sector, customers often lack real-time visibility into their deliveries, leading to frustration and frequent support requests. Delivery agents face challenges in updating shipment statuses promptly, and managers struggle to monitor delivery performance across regions. The absence of automation results in delayed communication, overlapping assignments, and poor customer experience.
